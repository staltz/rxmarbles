If `g` is as above and `_` is `R.__`, the\n\t * following are equivalent:\n\t *\n\t *   - `g(1, 2, 3)`\n\t *   - `g(_, 2, 3)(1)`\n\t *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1)(2)`\n\t *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1, 2)`\n\t *   - `g(_, 2)(1)(3)`\n\t *   - `g(_, 2)(1, 3)`\n\t *   - `g(_, 2)(_, 3)(1)`\n\t *\n\t * @func\n\t * @memberOf R\n\t * @since v0.1.0\n\t * @category Function\n\t * @sig (* -> a) -> (* -> a)\n\t * @param {Function} fn The function to curry.\n\t * @return {Function} A new, curried function.\n\t * @see R.curryN\n\t * @example\n\t *\n\t *      var addFourNumbers = (a, b, c, d) => a + b + c + d;\n\t *\n\t *      var curriedAddFourNumbers = R.curry(addFourNumbers);\n\t *      var f = curriedAddFourNumbers(1, 2);\n\t *      var g = f(3);\n\t *      g(4); //=> 10\n\t */\n\tmodule.exports = _curry1(function curry(fn) {\n\t  return curryN(fn.length, fn);\n\t});\n\n\n/***/ },\n/* 518 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\tvar _curry2 = __webpack_require__(463);\n\tvar _dispatchable = __webpack_require__(472);\n\tvar _makeFlat = __webpack_require__(519);\n\tvar _xchain = __webpack_require__(520);\n\tvar map = __webpack_require__(481);\n\t\n\t\n\t/**\n\t * `chain` maps a function over a list and concatenates the results. `chain`\n\t * is also known as `flatMap` in some libraries\n\t *\n\t * Dispatches to the `chain` method of the second argument, if present,\n\t * according to the [FantasyLand Chain spec](https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land#chain).\n\t *\n\t * @func\n\t * @memberOf R\n\t * @since v0.3.0\n\t * @category List\n\t * @sig Chain m => (a -> m b) -> m a -> m b\n\t * @param {Function} fn The function to map with\n\t * @param {Array} list The list to map over\n\t * @return {Array} The result of flat-mapping `list` with `fn`\n\t * @example\n\t *\n\t *      var duplicate = n => [n, n];\n\t *      R.chain(duplicate, [1, 2, 3]); //=> [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]\n\t *\n\t *      R.chain(R.append, R.head)([1, 2, 3]); //=> [1, 2, 3, 1]\n\t */\n\tmodule.exports = _curry2(_dispatchable(['chain'], _xchain, function chain(fn, monad) {\n\t  if (typeof monad === 'function') {\n\t    return function(x) { return fn(monad(x))(x); };\n\t  }\n\t  return _makeFlat(false)(map(fn, monad));\n\t}));\n\n\n/***/ },\n/* 519 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\tvar isArrayLike = __webpack_require__(486);\n\t\n\t\n\t/**\n\t * `_makeFlat` is a helper function that returns a one-level or fully recursive\n\t * function based on the flag passed in.\n\t *\n\t * @private\n\t */\n\tmodule.exports = function _makeFlat(recursive) {\n\t  return function flatt(list) {\n\t    var value, jlen, j;\n\t    var result = [];\n\t    var idx = 0;\n\t    var ilen = list.length;\n\t\n\t    while (idx < ilen) {\n\t      if (isArrayLike(list[idx])) {\n\t        value = recursive ?

Instead of producing\n * elements on the DOM, it generates HTML as strings and does a side effect on\n * those HTML strings. That side effect is described by the `effect` callback\n * function. So, if you want to use the HTML Driver on the server-side to render\n * your application as HTML and send as a response (which is the typical use\n * case for the HTML Driver), you need to pass something like the\n * `html => response.send(html)` function as the `effect` argument. This way,\n * the driver knows what side effect to cause based on the HTML string it just\n * rendered.\n *\n * The HTML driver is useful only for that side effect in the `effect` callback.\n * It can be considered a sink-only driver. However, in order to serve as a\n * transparent replacement to the DOM Driver when rendering from the server, the\n * HTML driver returns a source object that behaves just like the DOMSource.\n * This helps reuse the same application that is written for the DOM Driver.\n * This fake DOMSource returns empty streams when you query it, because there\n * are no user events on the server.\n *\n * `DOMSource.select(selector)` returns a new DOMSource with scope restricted to\n * the element(s) that matches the CSS `selector` given.\n *\n * `DOMSource.events(eventType, options)` returns an empty stream. The returned\n * stream is an *xstream* Stream if you use `@cycle/xstream-run` to run your app\n * with this driver, or it is an RxJS Observable if you use `@cycle/rxjs-run`,\n * and so forth.\n *\n * `DOMSource.elements()` returns the stream of HTML string rendered from your\n * sink virtual DOM stream.\n *\n * @param {Function} effect a callback function that takes a string of rendered\n * HTML as input and should run a side effect, returning nothing.\n * @param {HTMLDriverOptions} options an object with one optional property:\n * `transposition: boolean` enables/disables transposition of inner streams in\n * the virtual DOM tree.\n * @return {Function} the HTML driver function. The function expects a stream of\n * VNode as input, and outputs the DOMSource object.\n * @function makeHTMLDriver\n */\nvar makeHTMLDriver_1 = require(\"./makeHTMLDriver\");\nexports.makeHTMLDriver = makeHTMLDriver_1.makeHTMLDriver;\n/**\n * A factory function to create mocked DOMSource objects, for testing purposes.\n *\n * Takes a `streamAdapter` and a `mockConfig` object as arguments, and returns\n * a DOMSource that can be given to any Cycle.js app that expects a DOMSource in\n * the sources, for testing.\n *\n * The `streamAdapter` parameter is a package such as `@cycle/xstream-adapter`,\n * `@cycle/rxjs-adapter`, etc. Import it as `import a from '@cycle/rx-adapter`,\n * then provide it to `mockDOMSource. This is important so the DOMSource created\n * knows which stream library should it use to export its streams when you call\n * `DOMSource.events()` for instance.\n *\n * The `mockConfig` parameter is an object specifying selectors, eventTypes and\n * their streams. Example:\n *\n * ```js\n * const domSource = mockDOMSource(RxAdapter, {\n *   '.foo': {\n *     'click': Rx.Observable.of({target: {}}),\n *     'mouseover': Rx.Observable.of({target: {}}),\n *   },\n *   '.bar': {\n *     'scroll': Rx.Observable.of({target: {}}),\n *     elements: Rx.Observable.of({tagName: 'div'}),\n *   }\n * });\n *\n * // Usage\n * const click$ = domSource.select('.foo').events('click');\n * const element$ = domSource.select('.bar').elements();\n * ```\n *\n * The mocked DOM Source supports isolation. It has the functions `isolateSink`\n * and `isolateSource` attached to it, and performs simple isolation using\n * classNames. *isolateSink* with scope `foo` will append the class `___foo` to\n * the stream of virtual DOM nodes, and *isolateSource* with scope `foo` will\n * perform a conventional `mockedDOMSource.select('.__foo')` call.\n *\n * @param {Object} mockConfig an object where keys are selector strings\n * and values are objects. Those nested objects have `eventType` strings as keys\n * and values are streams you created.\n * @return {Object} fake DOM source object, with an API containing `select()`\n * and `events()` and `elements()` which can be used just like the DOM Driver's\n * DOMSource.\n *\n * @function mockDOMSource\n */\nvar mockDOMSource_1 = require(\"./mockDOMSource\");\nexports.mockDOMSource = mockDOMSource_1.mockDOMSource;\nexports.MockedDOMSource = mockDOMSource_1.MockedDOMSource;\n/**\n * The hyperscript function `h()` is a function to create virtual DOM objects,\n * also known as VNodes. Call\n *\n * ```js\n * h('div.myClass', {style: {color: 'red'}}, [])\n * ```\n *\n * to create a VNode that represents a `DIV` element with className `myClass`,\n * styled with red color, and no children because the `[]` array was passed. The\n * API is `h(tagOrSelector, optionalData, optionalChildrenOrText)`.\n *\n * However, usually you should use \"hyperscript helpers\", which are shortcut\n * functions based on hyperscript. There is one hyperscript helper function for\n * each DOM tagName, such as `h1()`, `h2()`, `div()`, `span()`, `label()`,\n * `input()`. For instance, the previous example could have been written\n * as:\n *\n * ```js\n * div('.myClass', {style: {color: 'red'}}, [])\n * ```\n *\n * There are also SVG helper functions, which apply the appropriate SVG\n * namespace to the resulting elements. `svg()` function creates the top-most\n * SVG element, and `svg.g`, `svg.polygon`, `svg.circle`, `svg.path` are for\n * SVG-specific child elements. Example:\n *\n * ```js\n * svg({width: 150, height: 150}, [\n *   svg.polygon({\n *     attrs: {\n *       class: 'triangle',\n *       points: '20 0 20 150 150 20'\n *     }\n *   })\n * ])\n * ```\n

Then, after both `first$` and `second$` are\n     * defined, we hook `secondProxy$` with `second$` with `imitate()` to tell\n     * that they are \"the same\". `imitate` will not trigger the start of any\n     * stream, it just binds `secondProxy$` and `second$` together.\n     *\n     * The following is an example where `imitate()` is important in Cycle.js\n     * applications. A parent component contains some child components. A child\n     * has an action stream which is given to the parent to define its state:\n     *\n     * <!-- skip-example -->\n     * ```js\n     * const childActionProxy$ = xs.create();\n     * const parent = Parent({...sources, childAction$: childActionProxy$});\n     * const childAction$ = parent.state$.map(s => s.child.action$).flatten();\n     * childActionProxy$.imitate(childAction$);\n     * ```\n     *\n     * Note, though, that **`imitate()` does not support MemoryStreams**. If we\n     * would attempt to imitate a MemoryStream in a circular dependency, we would\n     * either get a race condition (where the symptom would be \"nothing happens\")\n     * or an infinite cyclic emission of values. It's useful to think about\n     * MemoryStreams as cells in a spreadsheet. It doesn't make any sense to\n     * define a spreadsheet cell `A1` with a formula that depends on `B1` and\n     * cell `B1` defined with a formula that depends on `A1`.\n     *\n     * If you find yourself wanting to use `imitate()` with a\n     * MemoryStream, you should rework your code around `imitate()` to use a\n     * Stream instead. Look for the stream in the circular dependency that\n     * represents an event stream, and that would be a candidate for creating a\n     * proxy Stream which then imitates the target Stream.\n     *\n     * @param {Stream} target The other stream to imitate on the current one.
