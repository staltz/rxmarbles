Refer to the documentation of `run()` for\n\t * more details.\n\t *\n\t * **Example:**\n\t * ```js\n\t * import {setup} from '@cycle/rxjs-run';\n\t * const {sources, sinks, run} = setup(main, drivers);\n\t * // ...\n\t * const dispose = run(); // Executes the application\n\t * // ...\n\t * dispose();\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * @param {Function} main a function that takes `sources` as input\n\t * and outputs a collection of `sinks` Observables.\n\t * @param {Object} drivers an object where keys are driver names and values\n\t * are driver functions.\n\t * @return {Object} an object with three properties: `sources`, `sinks` and\n\t * `run`. `sources` is the collection of driver sources, `sinks` is the\n\t * collection of driver sinks, these can be used for debugging or testing. `run`\n\t * is the function that once called will execute the application.\n\t * @function setup\n\t */\n\tfunction setup(main, drivers) {\n\t    return run_1.setup(main,

The curried function has two unusual capabilities. First, its\n\t * arguments needn't be provided one at a time. If `g` is `R.curryN(3, f)`, the\n\t * following are equivalent:\n\t *\n\t *   - `g(1)(2)(3)`\n\t *   - `g(1)(2, 3)`\n\t *   - `g(1, 2)(3)`\n\t *   - `g(1, 2, 3)`\n\t *\n\t * Secondly, the special placeholder value `R.__` may be used to specify\n\t * \"gaps\", allowing partial application of any combination of arguments,\n\t * regardless of their positions. If `g` is as above and `_` is `R.__`, the\n\t * following are equivalent:\n\t *\n\t *   - `g(1, 2, 3)`\n\t *   - `g(_, 2, 3)(1)`\n\t *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1)(2)`\n\t *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1, 2)`\n\t *   - `g(_, 2)(1)(3)`\n\t *   - `g(_, 2)(1, 3)`\n\t *   - `g(_, 2)(_, 3)(1)`\n\t *\n\t * @func\n\t * @memberOf R\n\t * @since v0.5.0\n\t * @category Function\n\t * @sig Number -> (* -> a) -> (* -> a)\n\t * @param {Number} length The arity for the returned function.\n\t * @param {Function} fn The function to curry.\n\t * @return {Function} A new, curried function.\n\t * @see R.curry\n\t * @example\n\t *\n\t *      var sumArgs = (...args) => R.sum(args);\n\t *\n\t *      var curriedAddFourNumbers = R.curryN(4, sumArgs);\n\t *      var f = curriedAddFourNumbers(1, 2);\n\t *      var g = f(3);\n\t *      g(4); //=> 10\n\t */\n\tmodule.exports = _curry2(function curryN(length, fn) {\n\t  if (length === 1) {\n\t    return _curry1(fn);\n\t  }\n\t  return _arity(length, _curryN(length, [], fn));\n\t});\n\n\n/***/ },\n/* 475 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = function _arity(n, fn) {\n\t  /* eslint-disable no-unused-vars */\n\t  switch (n) {\n\t    case 0: return function() { return fn.apply(this, arguments); };\n\t    case 1: return function(a0) { return fn.apply(this, arguments); };\n\t    case 2: return function(a0, a1) { return fn.apply(this, arguments); };\n\t    case 3: return function(a0, a1, a2) { return fn.apply(this, arguments); };\n\t    case 4: return function(a0, a1, a2, a3) { return fn.apply(this, arguments); };\n\t    case 5: return function(a0, a1, a2, a3, a4) { return fn.apply(this, arguments); };\n\t    case 6: return function(a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5) { return fn.apply(this, arguments); };\n\t    case 7: return function(a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6) { return fn.apply(this, arguments); };\n\t    case 8: return function(a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7) { return fn.apply(this, arguments); };\n\t    case 9: return function(a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8) { return fn.apply(this, arguments); };\n\t    case 10: return function(a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9) { return fn.apply(this, arguments); };\n\t    default: throw new Error('First argument to _arity must be a non-negative integer no greater than ten');\n\t  }\n\t};\n\n\n/***/ },\n/* 476 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\tvar _arity = __webpack_require__(475);\n\tvar _isPlaceholder = __webpack_require__(467);\n\t\n\t\n\t/**\n\t * Internal curryN function.\n\t *\n\t * @private\n\t * @category Function\n\t * @param {Number} length The arity of the curried function.\n\t * @param {Array} received An array of arguments received thus far.\n\t * @param {Function} fn The function to curry.\n\t * @return {Function} The curried function.\n\t */\n\tmodule.exports = function _curryN(length, received, fn) {\n\t  return function() {\n\t    var combined = [];\n\t    var argsIdx = 0;\n\t    var left = length;\n\t    var combinedIdx = 0;\n\t    while (combinedIdx < received.length || argsIdx < arguments.length) {\n\t      var result;\n\t      if (combinedIdx < received.length &&\n\t          (!_isPlaceholder(received[combinedIdx]) ||\n\t           argsIdx >= arguments.length)) {\n\t        result = received[combinedIdx];\n\t      } else {\n\t        result = arguments[argsIdx];\n\t        argsIdx += 1;\n\t      }\n\t      combined[combinedIdx] = result;\n\t      if (!_isPlaceholder(result)) {\n\t        left -= 1;\n\t      }\n\t      combinedIdx += 1;\n\t    }\n\t    return left <= 0 ?

When any of the input streams emits an event, that event together\n     * with all the other saved events are combined into an array. That array will\n     * be emitted on the output stream. It's essentially a way of joining together\n     * the events from multiple streams.\n     *\n     * Marble diagram:\n     *\n     * ```text\n     * --1----2-----3--------4---\n     * ----a-----b-----c--d------\n     *          combine\n     * ----1a-2a-2b-3b-3c-3d-4d--\n     * ```\n     *\n     * Note: to minimize garbage collection, *combine* uses the same array\n     * instance for each emission.
